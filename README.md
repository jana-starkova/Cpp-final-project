# scary-stuff
<b>C++ Final Project</b>

This project is a final project of my C++ Programming 2 course (University of Bern, 2020). 

The goal is to create an app with a GUI and include an external library.

My app opens the user's camera and draws some "scary stuff" around. It's basically a nightmare simulator. The simulation begins with the user deciding how scared they would like to be. Then they simply sit back and relax. It is all fun and games, until spiders start walking on the user's face, he/she can hear creepy background noises or a ghost appears...

You have been warned.
